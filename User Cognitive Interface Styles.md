 # App/User Cognitive Interface Styles

 This file is meant to serve as an initial introduction to this project. I will begin with a conversational paragraph on this subject. I will then expand each prase or sentence of that paragraph with more content information. The content information will lay out the basics of the cognitive learning style model I will be using for the analysis of user interfaces.


 # Conversational Paragraph

 All user interfaces have to do with different learning style preferences. Basically all Microsoft products, for example, are built on a linear sequential cognitive organizational style. My own cognitive organizational style is highly organic, having a global rather than a sequential orientation and processing thoughts, concepts, notes and files through relationship links and associations, not through discrete unites. I do like archiving some things in hierarchies but designs with sequential orientations tend to interfere, for me, with original creative thinking and research, (even while they can work with innovation and adaptations of pre-existing ideas).

 # 1. All user interfaces have to do with different learning style preferences.

 - Learning style preferences in the context of user interface designs for apps and other computer related items are understood in terms of two learning process elements.
 - The first element of the learning process involves a style preference in cognitive orientation to a use challenge — preferences for how a problem or challenge is approached and framed.
 - The second element of the learning process involves preferences for cognitive organizational styles in the learning involved in the information processing in the actual use-process.
 - Stated briefly and simply, we are talking about how different people prefer to approach a new learning challenge and how they prefer to organize handling the information involved.
 - Four combinations are identified based on the general categories of wide or narrow focus preferences.  For example, this can be thought of in terms of framing a picture, focusing with a wide angle or narrow angle lens, making the picture meaningful in terms of background and context or foreground and singular subject.
 - The term, ***global***, is used to correspond to a wide angle, context cognitive orientation.
 - And the term, ***sequential,*** is used to correspond to correspond to a narrow, singular subject, central meaningful figure, cognitive orientation.


 ### Global / Sequential (G/S)

 - The Eagle-rule

 - A person may have a preference for approaching and framing a learning challenge with a wide angle lens, and so have a ***global*** cognitive orientation, while having a preference for organizing the processing of the information in a learning challenge with a ***sequential*** style.

 - Think of how a raptor, an eagle or a hawk surveys a scene from above with a wide angle lens, in order to focus in on a single point or figure on the ground and the immediate sequence of steps or moves available to that figure.

 - We will want to look at how this learning style preference might affect a user as a learner attempting to learn how to use a variety of different productivity apps.


 ### Sequential / Global (S/G)

 The Lion-rule

 - A person may have a preference for approaching and framing a learning challenge with a narrow angle lens, and so have a ***sequential*** cognitive orientation, while having a preference for organizing the process of the information in a learning challenge with a ***global*** style.

 - Think of how a lion begins with a narrow lens, a very narrowly focused consciousness of its own location, in order to survey and assess globally all that is in its immediate territory and environment. In order to deliberate and execute a movement, (experiential learning), decision, the lion will not assess its options in a linear way alone but will assess its options in a fully lateral way as well. Its global processing of all its options will determine its next step.



 ### Sequential / Sequential (S/S)

 The Ox-rule

 - A person may have a preference for approaching and framing a learning challenge with a narrow angle lens, and so have a ***sequential*** cognitive orientation, while having a preference for organizing the process of the information in a learning challenge with a ***sequential*** style. The result will be a linear proccessing of the learning challenge.

 - Think of how an ox orientates its thought and mind to the point where it is standing and thinks from that point. If there is a goal, what is the most direct way to take to get to that goal? If there are obsticals, what is the most direct and efficient path around the obstical or through the obstical? What is the first step and the next step after to be taken from this starting point to most effectively utilize the full resources of a whole field?


 ### Global / Global (G/G)

 - A person may have a preference for approaching and framing a learning challenge with a narrow angle lens, and so have a ***global*** cognitive orientation, while having a preference for organizing the process of the information in a learning challenge with a ***global*** style. The result will be an organic proccessing of the learning challenge, where the relationship between the elements are just as important as the elements themselves.

 - Think of how a primate physically senses everything within its sphere of travel. For the primate, leaning is learning to know its place and position in the whole sphere of its environment. It is through the wide focus of awareness and everything within that awareness being assessed in terms of their relationships that the subject of the learning challenge that the primate faces is understood in its essence and balance.



 ### An Additional General Remark on User Learning Styles

 Of course there are objective reasons for the use of wide or narrow lenses. Just as this is true in framing pictures with a camera, it is true in framing learning challenges with the mind. Still, different people have different preferences which will come strongly into play in many different situations. One of those will likely be in choosing productivity apps.

 The digital computer is designed according to linear sequential learning principles. Microsoft, the first most successful user interface followed suit and built its interface in line with its linear sequential software.

 Apple began the same but explored toward sequential/global and global/sequential user interface design elements.

 We are now in the age of applications and application design. This design world is moving in all directions with respect to learner and user interface. This is especially, therefore, what we are now looking at.

 I will put what this means to me in context, (my global framing orientation), and show how I see my organic style in its relationships with the other styles, (my global, hence organic, processing preference), by summarizing the model.

 ## Some Observations On Having An Organic Learning Style Preference

In the technological world the dominate learning style of the civilization is based on a local-sequential cognitive oriention, framing with a narrow focus the “subject” in the forground of the picture, even at its very centre, with context and organic environment elements and relationships relegated to the usually obscure background.

This makes people with a natural dispositon toward learning with a global oreintation to become more and more disadvantaged, in some ways marginalized, in some ways learning disabled. This is even more true for a global / global, organic style than a global / sequential, applicative style.


 Very slowly productivity apps are starting to appear that are beginning to be supportive of learning styles with global orientations. A few apps are even incorporating some elements and functions that support an organic learning style. There is quite a way to go.

#4. I do like archiving some things in hierarchies.    

 Every aspect and function related to learning has its own characteristics that give it a greater affinity, and therefore facility, toward being approached by one of the four learning styles.

 Any and every person has some aptitude in the use of all four styles, even while their personal preference and strongest aptitude will likely be with one style only.

 Using alphabetically arranged and/or heiarchical tree structures for organizing long term storage of filed information is probably easiest for most people under the present user interface conditions.



 # 5. but designs with sequential orientations tend to interfere, for me, with original creative thinking and research,

 For someone with an organic learning style, a global orientation and using associative processing, to be creative and to generate original thinking means to be learing style true and consistent. Trying to use productivity apps and organizational methods that are designed on sequential, reductionist, principles not only does not help or support organic creative and original thought, it hinders it.



 # (even while they can work with innovation and adaptations of pre-existing ideas).

 Sequential orientations and applications and functions designed on the principle of sequential orientations can, however, naturally allow or support one to produce adaptive, innovative thought, where the foundational concepts and designs are already a given.

 # End Thoughts and Beginning Thoughts On User Learning Styles
 
 The following are end thoughts for this introductory section. They are beginning thoughts for a planned for evaluation of some productivity apps to follow.

In using the model introduced above as a means of evaluating various productivity apps, it is assumed to be clear that every individual possess their own experiential learning style characteristics. I believe that any attempt to profile people as different types of learners is a dangerous mistake. Not only does all stereotyping have great potential to harm people, it ends up being a wasted effort. When individuals are targeted by organized groups using typology models the differences between individuals will, in the end, always end up being far more significant than the factors used to type them into categories. 

The model I am using here is meant to provide a window into commanalities that different people share that can be understood in relation to devices, programs, applications and other systems that they share use of in common.

Different individuals will have different histories with regard to the use and aptitude for using the four different approaches to experiential learning described in this model.

While there is evidence that people have preferences for one style over others from childhood, some people will be trained or educated in ways that make them highly capable in the use of more than one style or method of engaging experiential learning challenges. 

Through training, some people may be more capable in the use of one of the styles that would not be their natural preference than  they are in the use of that style that is, or would have been, more natural to them. This is analoguous to how someone who is naturally left handed might be trained to be better. at being right handed than left handed.

To continue with this analogy, some people will prove more naturally “ambidextrous” than others when it comes to these expereintial learning styles. While some people will prove to be very highly dependent on their naturally prefered experiential learning style.

Again, the aim of this work is not to identify the individual characteristics of different people as learners engaging with differnt user interfaces. The aim of this work is to do research into what information about this subject can be provided to people to help them identify for themselves what works best for them as users learning to use, and making use of, various productivity apps, and related tools.

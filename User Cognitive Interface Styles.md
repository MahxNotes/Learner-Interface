# App/User Cognitive Interface Styles

I will begin with a conversational paragraph on this subject. I will then expand each prase or sentence of that paragraph with more content information.

# Conversational Paragraph

All user interfaces have to do with different learning style preferences. Basically all Microsoft products, for example, are built on a linear sequential cognitive organizational style. My own cognitive organizational style is highly organic, having a global rather than a sequential orientation and processing thoughts, concepts, notes and files through relationship links and associations, not through discrete unites. I do like archiving some things in hierarchies but they tend to interfere with original creative thinking and research, (even while they can work with innovation and adaptations of pre-existing ideas).

# All user interfaces have to do with different learning style preferences.

- Learning style preferences in the context of user interface designs for apps and other computer related items are understood in terms of two learning process elements.
- The first element of the learning process involves a style preference in cognitive orientation to a use challenge — preferences for how a problem or challenge is approached and framed.
- The second element of the learning process involves preferences for cognitive organizational styles in the learning involved in the information processing in the actual use-process.
- Stated briefly and simply, we are talking about how different people prefer to approach a new learning challenge and how they prefer to organize handling the information involved.
- Four combinations are identified based on the general categories of wide or narrow focus preferences.  For example, this can be thought of in terms of framing a picture, focusing with a wide angle or narrow angle lens, making the picture meaningful in terms of background and context or foreground and singular subject.
- The term, ***global***, is used to correspond to a wide angle, context cognitive orientation.
- And the term, ***sequential,*** is used to correspond to correspond to a narrow, singular subject, central meaningful figure, cognitive orientation.


### Global / Sequential (G/S)

- The Eagle-rule

- A person may have a preference for approaching and framing a learning challenge with a wide angle lens, and so have a ***global*** cognitive orientation, while having a preference for organizing the processing of the information in a learning challenge with a ***sequential*** style.

- Think of how a raptor, an eagle or a hawk surveys a scene from above with a wide angle lens, in order to focus in on a single point or figure on the ground and the immediate sequence of steps or moves available to that figure.

- We will want to look at how this learning style preference might affect a user as a learner attempting to learn how to use a variety of different productivity apps.


### Sequential / Global (S/G)

The Lion-rule

- A person may have a preference for approaching and framing a learning challenge with a narrow angle lens, and so have a ***sequential*** cognitive orientation, while having a preference for organizing the process of the information in a learning challenge with a ***global*** style.

- Think of how a lion

   - Of course there are objective reasons for the use of wide or narrow lenses. Just as this is true in framing pictures with a camera, it is true in framing learning challenges with the mind. Still, different people have different preferences which will come strongly into play in many different situations. One of those will likely be in choosing productivity apps.
   
   
### Sequential / Sequential (S/S)

- A person may have a preference for approaching and framing a learning challenge with a narrow angle lens, and so have a ***sequential*** cognitive orientation, while having a preference for organizing the process of the information in a learning challenge with a ***sequential*** style. The result will be a linear proccessing of the learning challenge.

- Think of how an ox


### Global / Global (G/G)

- A person may have a preference for approaching and framing a learning challenge with a narrow angle lens, and so have a ***global*** cognitive orientation, while having a preference for organizing the process of the information in a learning challenge with a ***global*** style. The result will be an organic proccessing of the learning challenge, where the relationship between the elements are just as important as the elements themselves.

- Think of how a primate


# Basically all Microsoft products, for example, are built on a linear sequential cognitive organizational style.

The digital computer is designed according to linear sequential learning principles. Microsoft, the first most successful user interface followed suit and built its interface in line with its linear sequential software.

Apple began the same but explored toward sequential/global and global/sequential user interface design elements.

Linus explored in the same direction but less adventerously and less concretely.


# My own cognitive organizational style is highly organic,

## G/S can be thought of as

### Applicative 

Think:  The eagle overviews the scene, assesses it, then applies her assessment.


## S/G an be thought of as

### Explorative

Think: The lion surveys her environment, explores her options, takes opportunistic action.


## S/L an be thought of as

### Deductive

Think: the Ox takes stock of her postion, deduces her most effiecint and effective path, takes the first step.


## G/O an be thought of as

### Organic

Think: the primate senses the organic relationships surrounding her, weighs her balances, swings into action.


Having a global rather than a sequential orientation and processing thoughts, concepts, notes and files through relationship links and associations, not through discrete unites.

In the technological world the dominate learning style of the civilization is based on a local-sequential cognitive oriention, framing with a narrow focus the “subject” in the forground of the picture, even at its very centre, with context and organic environment elements and relationships relegated to the usually obscure background.

This makes people with a natural dispositon toward learning with a global oreintation to become more and more disadvantaged, in some ways marginalized, in some ways learning disabled.


# I do like archiving some things in hierarchies

Every aspect and function related to learning has its own characteristics that give it a greater affinity, and therefore facility, toward being approached by one of the four learning styles.

Any and every person has some aptitude in the use of all four styles, even while their personal preference and strongest aptitude will likely be with one style only.

Using alphabetically arranged and/or heiarchical tree structures for organizing long term storage of filed information is probably easiest for most people under the present user interface conditions.

# but they tend to interfere with original creative thinking and research,

For someone with an organic learning style, a global orientation and using associative processing, to be creative and to generate original thinking means to be learing style true and consistent. Trying to use productivity apps and organizational methods that are designed on sequential, reductionist, principles not only does not help or support organic creative and original thought, it hinders it.


# (even while they can work with innovation and adaptations of pre-existing ideas).

Sequential orientations and applications and functions designed on the principle of sequential orientations can, however, naturally allow or support one to produce adaptive, innovative thought, where the foundational concepts and designs are already a given.

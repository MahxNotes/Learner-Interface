# Learner-Interface
What are the different styles of mental learning organization that different people bring to the challenge of learning how to use and using different productivity apps?
First we examine the two different orientations people use to frame a new learning challenge.
Then we examine the two different methods people employ to organize and process the information in the learning challenge that they have framed.
We see that there are four possible experiential learning styles resulting from the possible combinations of these two style elements.
Having articulated this model, we can employ it for evaluating different productivity apps and how 'learner friendly' they are.
In conclusion we can begin to see why different productivity apps are more appealing to different people and for different use situations.
